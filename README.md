# Interval Timer for Obsidian ðŸ•”

Interval timer for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) mostly useful for the [Pomodoro Technique](https://www.pomodorotechnique.com/).

## Features

- Start, pause, and reset the timer (Of course, it's a timer!)
- Interval group count available
- Interval count and interval group count are always visible on your status bar
- Configurable work and break intervals
- Notify with system notification when the timer is done

## Installation

You can install with [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

This plugin is only for my personal use, so I have no plans to release it as a community plugin.
